                <p>User interviews are suppose to show the demographic you are trying to appeal too. In my interviews I interviewed people who were in the tech industry and tried to get a good feel for the type of people who might look at my site.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Competitor Analysis is a way to view the other people who are competiting against. In my competitor analysis I looked at other students getting ready to work in the tech industry as well as an experienced software engineer. This will not only set me apart from my competitors by knowing what I'll need in future but also making sure I don't do the same pitfalls. </p>

                <p>Used to map the features and weigh the cost of finishing them. Some of these features include features I thought needed to belong on all portfolio websites such as a navbar but also included some "nice to haves" such as a registered domain name</p>

                <p>User stories are a way to view your website as someone who you think will be looking at your portfolio. In my user stories I had my website viewed as a hiring mangerer as well as fellow software engineers. I made sure to highlight all the features presented in my feature matrix.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Cognitive Walkthroughs are neccessary for you to see how your website is working and being looked at by users. This was tough for me because you want people to find things they don't like about your site. This provided me with good information on what content would help set me apart from a normal candidate</p>

                <p>I chose to do a question test, and a click test for my website. I made sure to highlight somethings I thought might bother me as a user and see their opinions. I saw a good response to this and also some good constructed critism such as places on my website that weren't intuitive that I thought were.</p>

            <h1 class="final-summary" >Summary of Findings</h1>
            <span class="final-summary-content">
              <p>&emsp;From my research and user testing I learned a number of things that gave me insight on how my website should work, how to appeal to the people I am looking to apply too and helpful comments on areas I could improve. In my research I learned some features that could help benefit my site, some of which I wish I knew before I designed it. I found that if I did my research beforehand I could have saved myself alot of pain and anguish by prioritizing features that I thought were important. This resulted in some features that should have been in my prototype that didn't make the final build. One easy feature I could implemented was a "top of the page button" which was something on my feature matrix that was easy to implement yet didn't make it into the final build. User research ultimately highlighted some things I did in my process that would have removed alot of the confusion of "what to do first" and gave me insight on what other people are doing to get the same task I am trying to accomplished done.</p>
              <p>&emsp;With this knowledge in mind it lead me to do some user testing which gave me the most answers in terms of "what works and what doesn't". On my site I tested a number of things using a couple different test, it was these things that ultimately proved what people (because it was anonymous) thought about my site. While some of the opinions on my question test were subjective it gave me the knowledge I needed to see where people went when asked the same questions. The most helpful of the user testing however was the cognitive walkthroughs where I saw users use my site base on questions I asked them in person. In my walkthroughs I was able to get the opinion of a few developers whom I respected and got knowledge based on their opinions on what needed o be added to the site. If it wasn't for this I don't think I would have caught some of the design choices I made. For example I didn't realize that the github button next to a project is not something a nondeveloper would know was a link to download the project. All of which was very enlightening for me.</p>
              <p>&emsp;This all contributed to ways I could improve my site and helpped sprout even better ideas for the next iteration of what I want to do to improve it. Because of this experience I will definitely continue to build this site up and use it in all my applications.</p>

            <h1 class="final-summary">Incorporation of Findings</h1> 
            <span class="final-summary-content">
              <p>&emsp;After my findings I realized a lot of different things I need to add to my site to make it more competitive in the tech industry. For one I need to add some missing features that are present in software engineer's sites that are missing on my own. From my user research I made some assumptions that I thought would be good for a site to have but found that some of those ideas are things that some users don't really care about and that there are alot of things that they would rather prefer. For instance my project section although good for having alot of projects, lacked in certain aspects. So in the future I want to make sure the github button is actually a download button, this being because not everyone knows you can download from github, nor do they know what github is.</p>
              <p>&emsp;Aestheticly my website can be seen as nice but when going through a cognitive walkthrough it was brought to my attention that my website looks alot like microsoft powerpoint, so in the future I want to move over to a framework and rework my visuals. When I do this however I will make sure to take the proper steps as to get them done in a fast and well thought out manner. I will make sure to make a feature matrix on the new features such as a more modernized version of my about me probably with a cleaner design possibly cards that have backs and a slide show plugin rather than the javascript slideshow I made and probably add a live feed of my github showcasing my commits to projects and activities I am currently working on. I also want to add descriptions to all my projects that have dropdowns as so they don't become intrusive. All these features should have been in the prototype, but now that I have my user research/testing I know what I need to do in the future.</p>
